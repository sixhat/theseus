# Todo list of things to refactor for the next version:

- [] Use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) for documentation
- [] Create a REPL / TUI frontend for Theseus, maybe something using Textual (amazing TUIs) <https://www.textualize.io/>
- [] Setup a configuration file in Json/yaml/toml from that can be read / writed by the TUI App and controls everything about crawler for example.
- [] Define a set of common tasks that go to the TUI.
- [] Write Tests.
- [] Consider rename the final package as theseus is already in pypi
